# Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp) Design using Discrete Components

## Project Overview

This project details the design, simulation, and analysis of a discrete operational amplifier (Op-Amp) built using Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs). The entire design and its application circuits are simulated using LTspice. This work serves as a practical exploration of fundamental analog circuit design principles, showcasing the construction of an Op-Amp from basic components and evaluating its performance characteristics. The findings and methodologies are documented in the accompanying `Report.pdf` and `Presentation.pdf`.

## Circuit Design

### Core Op-Amp Architecture (`op_basic.asc`)
*   **Topology**: Multi-stage BJT-based operational amplifier.
    *   **Input Stage**: Differential amplifier for high common-mode rejection and high input impedance.
    *   **Intermediate Stage (Voltage Amplification Stage - VAS)**: High gain stage, typically a common-emitter configuration.
    *   **Output Stage**: Class AB push-pull or complementary emitter follower for low output impedance and efficient load driving.
*   **Biasing**: Utilizes resistor networks and potentially current mirrors for stable DC operating points.
*   **Compensation**: Includes a frequency compensation network (e.g., Miller capacitor) to ensure stability when feedback is applied.
*   **Simulation Environment**: LTspice XVII.

### Key Components (Typical examples, refer to `op_basic.asc` for exact parts)
*   **NPN Transistors**: e.g., BC547B, 2N2222
*   **PNP Transistors**: e.g., BC557B, 2N2907
*   **Diodes**: e.g., 1N4148 (for biasing, clamping, or thermal compensation)
*   **Resistors**: Various values for biasing, gain setting, and current limiting.
*   **Capacitors**: For coupling, bypassing, and frequency compensation (e.g., a small pF-range capacitor for Miller compensation).

## Performance Characteristics (Detailed in Report.pdf)

The designed Op-Amp is characterized by parameters such as:
*   **Open-Loop Voltage Gain (Avo)**: Typically very high.
*   **Input Impedance (Zin)**: High, especially for the differential input stage.
*   **Output Impedance (Zout)**: Low, to effectively drive loads.
*   **Unity Gain Bandwidth (UGBW)**: The frequency at which the open-loop gain drops to unity.
*   **Slew Rate (SR)**: The maximum rate of change of the output voltage.
*   **Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR)**: Ability to reject signals common to both inputs.
*   **Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR)**: Ability to reject variations in supply voltages.
*   **DC Offset Voltage**: Output voltage when inputs are grounded.

## Applications Demonstrated

The designed Op-Amp (`op_basic.asy` symbol used in applications) is tested in several common configurations:

1.  **Non-Inverting Amplifier (`amplifier.asc`)**
    *   Amplifies the input signal with a gain determined by a feedback network (1 + Rf/Rin).
    *   Maintains high input impedance.

2.  **Buffer Amplifier / Voltage Follower (`Ltspice Simulation/buffer.asc`)**
    *   Provides unity gain (Gain = 1).
    *   Features very high input impedance and very low output impedance.
    *   Used for impedance matching and isolating stages.

3.  **Active Band-Pass Filter (`band_pass.asc`)**
    *   Utilizes the Op-Amp with resistors and capacitors to create a filter that passes a specific range of frequencies while attenuating others.
    *   The center frequency and bandwidth are determined by component values.

4.  **Precision Half-Wave Rectifier (`Ltspice Simulation/half_wave_rectifier.asc`)**
    *   Overcomes the forward voltage drop of a simple diode rectifier by placing the diode in the Op-Amp's feedback loop.
    *   Allows for accurate rectification of small AC signals.

## How to Simulate

1.  Ensure you have **LTspice XVII** (or a compatible version) installed.
2.  Open any of the `.asc` files (e.g., `op_basic.asc`, `amplifier.asc`) in LTspice.
3.  Run the simulation (typically by clicking the "Run" button or from the "Simulate" menu).
    *   Different `.asc` files might have different simulation profiles (e.g., Transient, AC Analysis, DC Sweep) pre-configured.
4.  Analyze waveforms, DC operating points, or frequency responses as needed.
5.  The `op_basic.asy` file is a symbol that allows `op_basic.asc` to be used as a subcircuit component in other schematics (like the application circuits).
